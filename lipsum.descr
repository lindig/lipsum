lipsum - self-contained tool for literate programming in tradition of NoWeb

Lipsum is a command-line utility for literate programming. It stands in
the tradition of [Noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/), a popular
and flexible literate programming system by Norman Ramsey. The idea of
literate programming is to keep documentation for programmers and
program code in one file and to arrange it in a way that helps
understanding it best. To actually compile or run the code it needs to
be extracted from the literate program and Lipsum is a tool to do this.

Like Noweb, Lipsum employs a minimal markup to arrange documentation and
code in a file. Also like Noweb, Lipsum is language agnostic and can be
used for almost any programming language and documentation.

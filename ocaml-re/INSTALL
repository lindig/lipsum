Requirements

  The installation procedure defined in the Makefile requires findlib
  (http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/findlib/).

Installation

- Compile with "make all".

- If you have ocamlopt, do also "make opt".

- Become super-user if necessary and do "make install"
  (A "make uninstall" removes the library.)
